        <div class="author">By Karla Censine, Senior Reporter</div>
        <div class="text">Professor Arthur Vale, 58, has disappeared from his Whitby home. Colleagues say he recently found evidence of a hidden map in the town's archives. He mentioned a mysterious figure called 'The Cartographer'," said Dr. Miriam Shaw. "He became secretive, then vanished." Vale's study was ransacked. Rare documents are missing. Police are appealing for witnesses and treating the case as a high-priority investigation. Officers are conducting extensive searches across Whitby and surrounding coastal areas. Anyone with information should contact Whitby Police immediately.</div>

        <div class="author">By Bill Board, Advertising & Media Reporter</div>
        <div class="text">A small bakery in Lincoln has unexpectedly become a late-night hotspot after extending its hours to serve shift workers and night owls. Key Owner Lila Grant said the idea came after noticing empty streets but growing online demand. “People wanted fresh pastries at odd hours,” she explained. Since then, star Bakery has seen a strange spike in late-night deliveries that appear to arrive even when no orders were placed. Staff have begun joking that the bakery is “on star mode all night,” with croissants allegedly disappearing faster than they can be counted. Locals have praised the welcoming atmosphere, though some admit the bread now feels “suspiciously enthusiastic.” City officials are monitoring the trend as staff continue insisting nothing unusual is happening, despite the ovens occasionally “working overtime on their own.”</div>

        <div class="author">By Chris P. Bacon, Food & Lifestyle Editor</div>
        <div class="text">A local chef has been arrested after a controversial triangular pizza experiment caused unexpected chaos in a city restaurant. Head chef Marco Bellini said the idea came from a “harmless attempt to challenge traditional pizza geometry,” claiming customers were “ready for evolution.” Police were called after diners reported being served slices that did not fit on any standard plate and appeared to “reject circular reality entirely.” Stone based pizza described by one witness as “emotionally unsettling but weirdly tasty.” The restaurant has since been closed for inspection, while officials investigate whether triangular food shapes pose a threat to public order or just to common sense.</div>

        <div class="author">By Anita Report, Investigative Journalist</div>
        <div class="text">A Labrador named Max has amazed residents after traveling nearly 40 miles to reunite with his owner. The dog went missing during a camping trip but was later found waiting outside his owner's former home. Neighbours recognised Max and contacted local authorities, who scanned his microchip. Experts believe the dog followed familiar scents and landmarks. "It's incredible loyalty," said one volunteer. Max has since been safely returned and is recovering well, with his owner calling the reunion "nothing short of a miracle."</div>

        <div class="text">A group of engineering students has built a fully functioning solar-powered car using mostly recycled materials. The project, completed over six months, aimed to highlight sustainable innovation on a budget. Team leader Aisha Khan said the biggest challenge was balancing efficiency with durability. The car successfully completed a 15-mile test drive, impressing local sponsors and university staff. Plans are now underway to refine the design and enter it into a national competition.

        <div class="author">By Drew Peacock, Political Analyst</div>
        <div class="text">Scientists have confirmed that round objects roll more than square ones in what experts are calling the most expensive obvious discovery in modern science. The three-year study tested items including apples, wheels, and a very confident dinner plate that refused to cooperate on principle. Lead researcher Dr Helen Moore said, “We suspected round things would roll, but we didn't expect them to show off about it.” Square objects reportedly failed every test, with one cube described as “emotionally stable but physically disappointing.” One assistant added that the wheels “kept rolling away mid-experiment like they had somewhere better to be.” USB measurements were used to confirm rolling consistency across all test objects.The findings have sparked public outrage over funding, while officials defended the research, stating it was important to confirm what everyone already knew before school.</div>
